# pioneer
this is a project i originally came up with as an entry into the Pioneer Competition in hopes of placing in the top five among participants who attended Lambda School of Coputer Science and Web Development.
A placement in the top five would have secured me living stipends for the remainder of my time at Lambda School allowing me to leave my fulltime position at the automotive transimission plant and focus on Lambda curriculum 40+ hrs per week for 6 months rather than th 12-14 month parttime program i am enrolled in.
Unfortunately i succumbed to the time clock and became disqualified for a late update entry on the 4th week of 4. 

All that said, i stil lthink this is a cool project and worth further effort.

so TLDR competition project. didnt win. 

This application will eventually become a progressive web app to be used online or mobile in effort to educate the consumer 
of available clean energy options available tothem locally depenedent upon several variables,
some of which including: elemental availablilty to consumer provided gps/address/zipcode, 
more specifically: solar irradiance, wind speed watertable, geothermal activity. 
  Also of consideration: a database of already existing setups as well as a listing of local contractors 
  and time/ effort/ kwH return variables.
  
  
  i have based the visible page on a weather app built in django that i found online.
  the weather app calls on an api to return current temp, cloud cover and precipitation dependent upon city or zip code.
  
  
this is a folder on google drive that contains work on the project as well as a screenshot of the in depth application i submitted to the Pioneer tournament
